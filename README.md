# Evaluate a News article with Natural Language Processsing

## Summary

This project intention is to aplly the aquired knowledge during the **<ins>Udacity</ins>** course and the main focus is on **Webpack**.<br>

We needed to creat a web tool that allowed users to run Natural Language Processing (NLP) on articles or blogs found on other websites with the assistance of an a API called [Meaningcloud](https://www.meaningcloud.com/). The main focus is the validation of URL. This will tell us if the input is subjective (opinion) or objective (fact-based) and if it is positive, neutral, or negative and even if it is without sentiment in tone.

Besides **Webpack** we also used:
- Sass,
- Loaders and Plugins,
- Service workers
